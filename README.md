# CSV to Email Fields #

This small web app let's you paste a column of e-mails (from a CSV or MS Excel) and choose to explode them into multiple strings to copy directly into the "To:" field of your favorite mail client.

You can choose how many recipients you want for each mail, what delimiter you what to use in the recipient lists and if you wanna avoid (or not) possible duplicates in your initial list.
